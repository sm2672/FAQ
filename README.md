how you how to use Middleware in your laravel applications to restrict content or some specific pages based on user role. This comes very handy when you have a simp membership site with where users who pay for a subscription can see pages which are not visible by other users. Or if you have admin, user, super admin type of roles, then also this Middleware in laravel works well.

Access Control is an important aspect of any application dealing with user-specific content. It provides with userâ€™s ability to access specific applications components.
